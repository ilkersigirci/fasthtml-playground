I want to build a fasthtml youtube downloader app using following steps.

- The app uses yt-dlp to download youtube videos.
- The app has searchbar to search for youtube videos.
- The app has a download button to download the video.
- The app has a progress bar to show the download progress.
- When the user click the search button, the app will display the search results using video thumbnails and titles.
- When implementing youtube functionalities, you can refer metube folder in the project. It has the code for downloading youtube videos and searching youtube videos.
- Make the youtube related codes on the separate file called api/utils/youtube.py
- Make the fasthtml related codes on api/gui/yt_app.py
