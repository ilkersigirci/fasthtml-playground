I want to build a fasthtml youtube downloader app using following steps.

- The app uses yt-dlp to download youtube videos.
- The app has searchbar to search for youtube videos.
- The app has a download button to download the video.
- The app has a progress bar to show the download progress.
- When the user click the search button, the app will display the search results using video thumbnails and titles.
